# robotArmControlPanel-task1
This task is to design a control panel to control engines values of the robot arm and decide the status either on or off. This task is the base for the following tasks.
This task has opened the door for me to learn web languages . First of all , I was a beginner in html with no experience in css , javascript or DataBases.
So I was learning styling from different sources , including those which were mentioned in the meetings ( like W3School) .
I was able to create the html page but I faced some problems in range sliders and flipswitches design.
However , I wrote the html code myself but I used some sample related to style of the sliders and the flipswitch (on/off statuses).
Since the general theme or style applied to the whole section , I learned how to devide the code and add some classes and headers to apply specific style such as the page title and its background  as well as the range sliders text color. 
When it comes to the database , I wrote the code of php inside html code but it was not working and cause some errors related to the network.
However , I put the php code in a seperate file to work fine . 
I used the GET method but it was not successful in this situation since we are dealing with submitting data to a server , then it worked perfectly fine . 
In the last part , I encountered errors in the php code to show the values to the user where we should get the last refreshed data from the server .
I searched that part and learned the function mysqli_query to print values depending on the descending order of IDs , therefore the last ID values printed to the screen.
I learned also the echo function and other php functions to use them in the proper way and to not encounter syntax errors as any other programming language. 
The files uploaded with some screenShots in different stages of the task , index.html is the html file where I put the infrastructure code of the web page .
Moreover, the CSS file is the styling and designing file that I wrote about 40% of it and I took some per-defined parts with a little editing to be suit with the interface.
The insert.php file is where the php code and connection with the server and Database took place . 
This experience encouraged me and I inherit the maximum enthusiasm to learn more and sink in the world of web-programming both back and front end. I am happy to announce my acheivment even if it is simple and straight forward for an intermediate level web programmer.
I ensure the principle which say ' Everything is easy if you have the enthusiasm to do it' , all problems were exceeded by the search and try as well as understanding the concept of every function used before implementing it.
The smartMethods company , CEOs , all trainers are all thanked for their support and clarification.
